# Machine Learning Repository

Welcome to the Machine Learning (ML) repository! This repository contains various projects and exercises that I've completed during my machine learning journey. The main purpose of this repository is to showcase my skills and understanding of machine learning concepts and techniques, as well as to provide examples and inspiration for others who are learning or working in this field.

## Environment and Dependencies

- Python 3.6
- NumPy
- pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- SciPy

## Completed Projects

1. **Titanic Survival Prediction (Kaggle)**: In this project, I built a predictive model to determine the survival of passengers on the Titanic using various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. Feature engineering, data preprocessing, and model evaluation techniques were applied to improve the model's performance.

2. **Horse Colic Missing Data Handling**: This project focused on handling missing data in the Horse Colic dataset. I applied various imputation techniques, including mean and median imputation, and k-nearest neighbors imputation. The effectiveness of these techniques was evaluated by comparing the performance of machine learning models trained on the imputed datasets.

3. **ID3 Decision Tree Construction**: In this project, I implemented the ID3 decision tree algorithm from scratch to gain a deeper understanding of the inner workings of decision tree algorithms. I also compared the performance of the custom-built ID3 algorithm with scikit-learn's built-in decision tree classifier.

4. **Linear Regression Analysis of Prostate Cancer**: This project involved the application of linear regression techniques to the Prostate Cancer dataset. I used ordinary least squares, gradient descent, and stochastic gradient descent methods to build predictive models, and evaluated their performance using mean squared error and residual plots. I also applied cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to improve the performance of the stochastic gradient descent model.
